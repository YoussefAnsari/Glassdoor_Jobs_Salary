As you’ve probably guessed, OverDrive is a place that values individuality and variety. We don’t want you to be like everyone else, we don’t even want you to be like us—we want you to be like you! So, if you're interested in joining the OverDrive team, apply below and tell us what inspires you about OverDrive and why you think you are perfect for our team.

Data Studio Analyst,$73K-$134K (Glassdoor est.),"At Priceonomics, our core skill is making data interesting. How do you find a great idea in a dense data set? What’s the best way to present it? How do you create a story where the data is the main character?

As it turns out, there is commercial value in telling a story focused on data. Companies have lots of data, but they have less experience in using it to tell stories that will spread on the Internet.

That’s a shame, because when it comes to content marketing, people seem to actually like it when companies share exciting insights from their data. When you approach a company’s data like a journalist telling a story or an analyst uncovering a trend—rather than a marketer engaging in pure self-promotion—you can produce work that will get your friends talking and gain the attention of publications like The Economist and the New York Times.

In December, we launched The Priceonomics Data Studio, a content marketing agency that helps companies turn their data into stories that spread. Although our data studio is only a few months old, we now work with dozens of companies, including Fortune 100 corporations, “unicorn” tech companies, and small startups. Half our customers are B2B (they sell to businesses) and half are B2C (they sell to consumers).

Working with companies, we’ve told data-driven stories on topics ranging from the driving preferences of Democrats and Republicans to the average size of a bridal party in weddings across the country.

To grow the Priceonomics Data Studio and create more interesting data stories, we need help meeting the demand. Maybe you are interested?

We are looking for people who are comfortable working with data to help us turn data into content for our clients. We’ll send you a raw data file, some thoughts on the topic, and a template for how the charts should look. You’ll create an awesome data-driven article with our help.

For each piece, we’ll pay you (generally around $1000). We’re looking to work closely with people who can work quickly with data, have a knack for visualization, and can complete projects like this in approximately 10 hours or less. If you’re good at this and enjoy it, you can work on nearly as many of these projects with us as you like.

So, are you interested? We need two things from you. First, an honest assessment of if you can do this sort of work. Second, the answer to a very quick “data puzzle.”

1. A quick puzzle

Tell us the median price of booking a room in each of the top 100 cities in this data set.

You can download the data here and read the “backstory” here. This is a fictional data set, but it’s very typical of the kind of raw information we analyze for a Priceonomics Blog post or a project in our Data Studio.

More specifically, send us back a table with a list of the median price in each city, ranked from most to least expensive. Restrict your analysis to just to the ""top 100"" cities that have the most units on the market.

You can also briefly describe how you solved it, any assumptions you made, or even send us the work. If some parts of the results look odd, you can propose how you’d improve the analysis given the data available in the file.

This puzzle should be a relatively quick task—not something that requires lots of brute force. If you need a hint on how to do this, here’s one.

2. An honest assessment

Companies give us data, and we turn it into interesting stories. Here are some examples of how we used data about driving preferences, bridal parties, and consumer spending habits at the grocery story. Can you do this sort of work?

It requires making maps and tables—and telling a story. It also requires fluency in Excel or a difference analysis program like R. If you know how to use Excel, can you perform: a pivot table, a vlookup, an index-match, an array, and the mid function?

Maybe you’re a PhD student, a data journalist at a blog, or a recovering management consultant who wants to work with interesting data and make some extra money.

Whatever your situation, tell us about your background and why you can do this sort of work.

To apply to become part of this program, just send an email to jobs@priceonomics.com with the answers to these questions. Feel free to let us know anything else we should know about you in the email.

We love a good story about data, and we look forward to creating some with you.

***

We’re also hiring a full time Writer/Analyst to join us in San Francisco. You’ll work at crunching data and telling stories for our customers and on the Priceonomics Blog. If you’re interested in a full time job, complete the puzzle and then send us a message at jobs@priceonomics.com.

Working in the analysis phase of the requirements/system development cycle, a data interchange implementation analyst consults with users to determine business requirements, identify operating procedures, evaluate existing or proposed systems, and prepare specifications from which programs will be written. Defining business processes is elementary to you, Detective Holmes.

The fundamentals for the job
Create, update, enhance, or refine business requirements documents (BRDs)
Create, update, enhance, or refine use cases and test cases
Translate ideas into requirements (Hint: Google won't help you here)
Lead User Acceptance Testing (UAT) efforts
Document and assist with user acceptance tests to ensure that documented requirements and business needs are being met
Talk the talk so you can gather project requirements with internal/external clients and technology teams
Prepare extensively detailed documentation of business requirements, use cases, and test cases
Oversee the process of defining requirements and processes to assess the need to help identify solutions for business needs
Help execute cross-functional projects
Analyze business solution options

Determine feasibility of business requirements and recommend changes to support business needs and processes.

Provide support to Quality Assurance on development of test approaches.
Provide support to Applications Development through participation in Design Reviews
Create project estimates and resource plans for systems solutions
What you're made of

The bold requirements
Bachelor's Degree (In lieu of a degree, equivalent relevant experience may be considered.)
5+ years of experience in Product Analysis, Business Analysis, and/or System Analysis.
Computer proficiency. Your Microsoft Office Suite skills (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook) are Jedi level.
You must be able to communicate effectively (read, write, meme, wish, and curse) in English. Spanish is a plus!
Double plus points for knowledge of Healthcare, Pharmacy, and Pharmacy Benefit industries, Medicare Part D, and CMS regulations.
Previous PBM/Health plan experience is a big plus.
Knowledge on healthcare data standards like HIPAA X12, NCPDP and similar is highly desired.
That something extra we´d love to see
Challenge Accepted: You love a challenge. In fact, you get bored if not challenged, and that's good, because we will challenge you to be the best.
Leader/Mentor: You like it when people succeed and even more when it's someone from your team. You advise, counsel, guide, teach, preach, and overreach, sprinkling your pixie dust so everyone can shine.
Organization Guru: You crave organization like sugar, color-code everything, and messes make you crazy.
Detailed: Nothing gets by you and you rarely forget a thing. When learning some new procedure, you're the type to take notes. When everyone else is still lost, you're already at the next steps. Others count on this skill of yours. Maybe due to your detailed nature, you are also exquisitely good at planning. You like to make plans and follow through, meticulously.
Analytical and Critical Thinking: Obviously because this is an ""analyst"" position, but even if you weren't applying, you'd still be trying to analyze why we write these the way we do and how they could be better.
Customer Service: Your attention to detail focuses on the customer so you know what they need even before they do. You manage difficult emotional customer situations with grace, meet commitments, and respond to service and assistance requests.

Data Interchange Implementation Analyst I,$41K-$75K (Glassdoor est.),"What you'll do

In a few words

A Data Interchange Implementation Analyst I is top detective. Your attention to detail and sharp observational skills help you understand and see what others can't. Working in the analysis phase of the requirements/system development cycle, a data interchange implementation analyst consults with users to determine business requirements, identify operating procedures, evaluate existing or proposed systems, and prepare specifications from which programs will be written. Defining business processes is elementary to you, Detective Holmes.

The fundamentals for the job
Create, update, enhance, or refine business requirements documents (BRDs)
Create, update, enhance, or refine use cases and test cases
Translate ideas into requirements (Hint: Google won't help you here)
Lead User Acceptance Testing (UAT) efforts
Document and assist with user acceptance tests to ensure that documented requirements and business needs are being met
Talk the talk so you can gather project requirements with internal/external clients and technology teams
Prepare extensively detailed documentation of business requirements, use cases, and test cases
Oversee the process of defining requirements and processes to assess the need to help identify solutions for business needs
Help execute cross-functional projects
Analyze business solution options
Understand the applications supported and their upstream/downstream impact
Determine feasibility of business requirements and recommend changes to support business needs and processes.
Work collaboratively with business partners, SMEs, Developers, and Testers to ensure a shared understanding of business requirements
Ensure that system solution options are thoroughly researched, analyzed and documented. (We know one can never research enough, but as long as it's thorough...)
Provide support to Quality Assurance on development of test approaches.
Provide support to Applications Development through participation in Design Reviews
Create project estimates and resource plans for systems solutions
What you're made of

The bold requirements
Bachelor's Degree (In lieu of a degree, equivalent relevant experience may be considered.)
5+ years of experience in Product Analysis, Business Analysis, and/or System Analysis.
Computer proficiency. Your Microsoft Office Suite skills (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook) are Jedi level.
You must be able to communicate effectively (read, write, meme, wish, and curse) in English. Spanish is a plus!
Double plus points for knowledge of Healthcare, Pharmacy, and Pharmacy Benefit industries, Medicare Part D, and CMS regulations.
Previous PBM/Health plan experience is a big plus.
Knowledge on healthcare data standards like HIPAA X12, NCPDP and similar is highly desired.
That something extra we´d love to see
Challenge Accepted: You love a challenge. In fact, you get bored if not challenged, and that's good, because we will challenge you to be the best.
Leader/Mentor: You like it when people succeed and even more when it's someone from your team. You advise, counsel, guide, teach, preach, and overreach, sprinkling your pixie dust so everyone can shine.
Organization Guru: You crave organization like sugar, color-code everything, and messes make you crazy.
Detailed: Nothing gets by you and you rarely forget a thing. When learning some new procedure, you're the type to take notes. When everyone else is still lost, you're already at the next steps. Others count on this skill of yours. Maybe due to your detailed nature, you are also exquisitely good at planning. You like to make plans and follow through, meticulously.
Analytical and Critical Thinking: Obviously because this is an ""analyst"" position, but even if you weren't applying, you'd still be trying to analyze why we write these the way we do and how they could be better.
Customer Service: Your attention to detail focuses on the customer so you know what they need even before they do. You manage difficult emotional customer situations with grace, meet commitments, and respond to service and assistance requests.

In a few words

A Data Interchange Implementation Analyst I is top detective. Your attention to detail and sharp observational skills help you understand and see what others can't. Working in the analysis phase of the requirements/system development cycle, a data interchange implementation analyst consults with users to determine business requirements, identify operating procedures, evaluate existing or proposed systems, and prepare specifications from which programs will be written. Defining business processes is elementary to you, Detective Holmes.

Create, update, enhance, or refine business requirements documents (BRDs)
Create, update, enhance, or refine use cases and test cases
Translate ideas into requirements (Hint: Google won't help you here)
Lead User Acceptance Testing (UAT) efforts

Talk the talk so you can gather project requirements with internal/external clients and technology teams
Prepare extensively detailed documentation of business requirements, use cases, and test cases

Provide support to Applications Development through participation in Design Reviews
Create project estimates and resource plans for systems solutions
What you're made of

The bold requirements
Bachelor's Degree (In lieu of a degree, equivalent relevant experience may be considered.)
5+ years of experience in Product Analysis, Business Analysis, and/or System Analysis.
Computer proficiency. Your Microsoft Office Suite skills (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook) are Jedi level.
You must be able to communicate effectively (read, write, meme, wish, and curse) in English. Spanish is a plus!
Double plus points for knowledge of Healthcare, Pharmacy, and Pharmacy Benefit industries, Medicare Part D, and CMS regulations.
Previous PBM/Health plan experience is a big plus.
Knowledge on healthcare data standards like HIPAA X12, NCPDP and similar is highly desired.
That something extra we´d love to see
Challenge Accepted: You love a challenge. In fact, you get bored if not challenged, and that's good, because we will challenge you to be the best.
Leader/Mentor: You like it when people succeed and even more when it's someone from your team. You advise, counsel, guide, teach, preach, and overreach, sprinkling your pixie dust so everyone can shine.
Organization Guru: You crave organization like sugar, color-code everything, and messes make you crazy.
Detailed: Nothing gets by you and you rarely forget a thing. When learning some new procedure, you're the type to take notes. When everyone else is still lost, you're already at the next steps. Others count on this skill of yours. Maybe due to your detailed nature, you are also exquisitely good at planning. You like to make plans and follow through, meticulously.
Analytical and Critical Thinking: Obviously because this is an ""analyst"" position, but even if you weren't applying, you'd still be trying to analyze why we write these the way we do and how they could be better.
Customer Service: Your attention to detail focuses on the customer so you know what they need even before they do. You manage difficult emotional customer situations with grace, meet commitments, and respond to service and assistance requests.

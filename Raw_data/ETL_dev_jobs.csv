The team is currently taking patient data ( Lab results, doctors notes, Rx prescribed, surgical procedures, etc.) from their existing EMR ( Electronic Medical Records) and moving it into another application. This specific transfer requires 16 different files.
Another project they are working on is one that is funded through a state-wide program for Florida. They are taking similar patient information ( different enough that a new query needs to be run) and compiling it into a centralized program.Â",4.6,"Conch Technologies, Inc

WMS / Sql Developer,$73K-$116K (Glassdoor est.),"Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom, I am Partner & VP at RSM Solutions Inc, and about 99% of my time is spent 'customer-facing'. That being said, their are no 'layers' between me and my clients. Most of my clients - like this one - are individuals I have known for many many years. I am going to be more interested in 'fit' than anything else... a 'fit' for you and a 'fit' for the client. I also like to add a little humor to my job descriptions, so you will see some humor in this job description as well.

This particular client is one that has a very very high ‘hit rate’…by this, I mean that the people that work there typically stick around for a very very long time. This is also an environment with limited drama...(if you are a Shakespeare fan) it is not like working with the Capulets and the Montagues.

This is a permanent role as opposed to a contract role, so I cannot work with EAD or H1 Visa holders for this role. I can only work with US Citizens and Green Card Holders.

The location for this role is in Wauconda, Illinois. They are anticipating an onsite / offsite mix for this role, where 2-3 days would be remote and the other 2 days would be onsite in Wauconda. These guys are new to this onsite / offisite mix, so it may take a little getting used to for them.

For this particular role, here are the 'got to haves':

1) No drama...this is an environment that thrives on collaboration. If you are stuck, it is important to ask others for help. This also means that if you believe the world revolves around you, you probably should call the Kardashians...I think they are hiring.

2) Someone that is accountable, helpful to others, resourceful, and can set deadlines for themselves that they know are achievable.

3) Someone who really wants to learn more and grow...the hiring manager for this role is happy to help you advance your career and help you learn...but you need to want to do that in order for that to happen.

Here is the modified JD

WMS / Sql Developer

The location for this role is in Wauconda, Illinois. They are anticipating an onsite / offsite mix for this role, where 2-3 days would be remote and the other 2 days would be onsite in Wauconda. These guys are new to this onsite / offisite mix, so it may take a little getting used to for them. This company is new to the onsite /offsite mix ‘game’…so their may be more onsite time in the beginning and then move to a onsite /offsite mix

Skill Set Needed: We are seeking a developer with strong WMS experience with Sql (especially stored procedures). From a WMS perspective, this client uses Datex. You don’t need to have specific Datex experience…but experience with WMS systems will be needed. From a WMS experience point of view, we are looking for individuals with experience with how a WMS works (order waves, releasing orders to the floor, shipping, packing slips, units of measures, etc..). This client is seeking someone that has some real breath and depth in terms of WMS…so, they are going to ask about the following:

1) What WMS packages you have experience with

2) What you did, in terms of development, with regard to WMS.

3) What were those WMS packages based on…this clients WMS is based on Sql.

The WMS package is based off of Sql…so, experience with Sql (especially Stored Procedures) will definitely be needed for success here as well. Their data flows utilize Microsoft Workflow (which is also based off of Sql).

We will need experience with:

1) Building applications, on your own, from start to finish….this is an environment that thrives on collaboration. So, you will not be alone in this, you will have others there to help you and it is encouraged for you to reach out to your colleagues to help you move through projects as well.

2) Experience in WMS from a development perspective…for example, what WMS packages have you worked on, what aspects of those WMS packages did you work on…

3) Experience in the 3PL (3rd Party Logistics) arena…or at least experience in the warehousing industry / vertical.

4) Experience with Datex PowerHouse would be beneficial

5) Experience with EDI would be beneficial

6) From a Development point of view (outside of WMS), we are seeking experience with

WMS / Sql Developer,$69K-$94K (Glassdoor est.),"Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom, I am Partner & VP at RSM Solutions Inc, and about 99% of my time is spent 'customer-facing'. That being said, their are no 'layers' between me and my clients. Most of my clients - like this one - are individuals I have known for many many years. I am going to be more interested in 'fit' than anything else... a 'fit' for you and a 'fit' for the client. I also like to add a little humor to my job descriptions, so you will see some humor in this job description as well.

This particular client is one that has a very very high ‘hit rate’…by this, I mean that the people that work there typically stick around for a very very long time. This is also an environment with limited drama...(if you are a Shakespeare fan) it is not like working with the Capulets and the Montagues.

This is a permanent role as opposed to a contract role, so I cannot work with EAD or H1 Visa holders for this role. I can only work with US Citizens and Green Card Holders.

The location for this role is in Wauconda, Illinois. They are anticipating an onsite / offsite mix for this role, where 2-3 days would be remote and the other 2 days would be onsite in Wauconda. These guys are new to this onsite / offisite mix, so it may take a little getting used to for them.

For this particular role, here are the 'got to haves':

1) No drama...this is an environment that thrives on collaboration. If you are stuck, it is important to ask others for help. This also means that if you believe the world revolves around you, you probably should call the Kardashians...I think they are hiring.

2) Someone that is accountable, helpful to others, resourceful, and can set deadlines for themselves that they know are achievable.

3) Someone who really wants to learn more and grow...the hiring manager for this role is happy to help you advance your career and help you learn...but you need to want to do that in order for that to happen.

Here is the modified JD

WMS / Sql Developer

The location for this role is in Wauconda, Illinois. They are anticipating an onsite / offsite mix for this role, where 2-3 days would be remote and the other 2 days would be onsite in Wauconda. These guys are new to this onsite / offisite mix, so it may take a little getting used to for them. This company is new to the onsite /offsite mix ‘game’…so their may be more onsite time in the beginning and then move to a onsite /offsite mix

Skill Set Needed: We are seeking a developer with strong WMS experience with Sql (especially stored procedures). From a WMS perspective, this client uses Datex. You don’t need to have specific Datex experience…but experience with WMS systems will be needed. From a WMS experience point of view, we are looking for individuals with experience with how a WMS works (order waves, releasing orders to the floor, shipping, packing slips, units of measures, etc..). This client is seeking someone that has some real breath and depth in terms of WMS…so, they are going to ask about the following:

1) What WMS packages you have experience with

2) What you did, in terms of development, with regard to WMS.

3) What were those WMS packages based on…this clients WMS is based on Sql.

The WMS package is based off of Sql…so, experience with Sql (especially Stored Procedures) will definitely be needed for success here as well. Their data flows utilize Microsoft Workflow (which is also based off of Sql).

We will need experience with:

1) Building applications, on your own, from start to finish….this is an environment that thrives on collaboration. So, you will not be alone in this, you will have others there to help you and it is encouraged for you to reach out to your colleagues to help you move through projects as well.

2) Experience in WMS from a development perspective…for example, what WMS packages have you worked on, what aspects of those WMS packages did you work on…

3) Experience in the 3PL (3rd Party Logistics) arena…or at least experience in the warehousing industry / vertical.

4) Experience with Datex PowerHouse would be beneficial

5) Experience with EDI would be beneficial

6) From a Development point of view (outside of WMS), we are seeking experience with

We are seeking a full time (or nearly full time for someone who cannot commit to full time) developer to assist with continuous development and maintenance of our integrated systems. This is not a position that involves doing the same things day in and day out, or working only on one area of a product. Working on site in our office in Raleigh is necessary.

Our stack includes proprietary internal systems built on MS SQL local and cloud for back end, Angular, APIs and other direct connections to industry specific applications like finfolio, Yodlee, and general use applications like Sharefile.

We also have a client facing website using Azure and Angular for the browser front end. The client website is integrated with our other systems.

We have an extensive proprietary stack due to the limitations of the industry specific solutions and platforms. Our philosophy is to utilize outside applications when they provide needed functionality and can be integrated with APIs or direct db connections. We are also constantly evaluating if there are new or improved outside applications that we should purchase and integrate to either add new functionality, replace existing outside applications or parts of our internal systems.

Ideal candidate would have both a high level of aptitude with MS SQL, as well as the ability to develop and refine direct integrations using APIs when available, and ad hoc approaches when necessary. Angular experience a plus.

We have two developers currently who have worked with us for several years, so you will have extensive support.

Since we are the only customer for our software, our development process can be highly agile as we can test functionality live in many cases and get immediate feedback from our team on bugs and suggested improvements.

Compensation and benefits to be determined according to ability and experience.

When applying, please complete the assessment, it will only take about 15 minutes, and if you're a good fit for us, the assessment should be at least a little bit fun for you.

We remain committed to putting our people, customers, and communities first and appreciate your patience and flexibility as we work through this.
The (quality) doctor is in.
Modio has streamlined the convoluted and messy process that is healthcare credentialing and saved countless years of manual and error-prone work in the process. As part of CHG Healthcare we are working to drastically improve the speed (and quality) of credentialing to ensure that our doctors can spend more time treating (millions) of patients each year and less time dealing with credentialing headaches.
Our industry is growing and demand is high. This means you’ll have plenty of opportunities to grow and develop in your career. Keeping healthcare healthy can be as fun as it is rewarding.
We are open to this role being in our offices in Salt Lake City, Utah or San Francisco, California.

You understand how to design software and systems that are maintainable, robust, easy to understand, and capable of scaling. You also know that not every solution needs to be over-engineered.
You should be able to debug technical issues, even if the issue isn’t from “your code” or “your system”.
Your qualifications:
5+ years’ experience working with production data. Must understand things like data normalization, relational databases, data cleansing, data sandboxing, data pipelines, BI/ETL tools, and a bunch of other stuff.
Strong proficiency writing SQL. Reading SQL is a plus.
Experience working with data integration like Pentaho (or similar).
Experience setting up and maintaining data pipelines.
Professional experience working on backend API code (Node.js/TypeScript Preferred but not a hard requirement). Familiarity with defensive coding practices preferred.

Engage through more human experiences
As a Senior Data Engineer, you will report to the Head of Data and work closely with other members of the Data team to maintain and improve data pipelines, deploy predictive models as a service, and work on our data infrastructure.

Team Philosophy:
We believe that data engineers should not write ETL, unless data pipelines are necessary to support the services that we build and maintain. Instead, your time is better spent writing tooling and creating abstractions to support the work of analysts and data scientists on the team, so that other users in the company can write and maintain their own ETL.
Everyone on the team is considered and treated as a Senior, so you are given a lot of ownership over the projects you're working on. With this in mind, we expect you to write code that is well tested, modular, and maintainable. We frown at instances of destructive fire fighting, caused by badly designed architecture or mismanaged projects.
We like learners. Hence, we create an environment where Data Scientists learn the skills and abstraction patterns of Software Engineers and Data Engineers learn the iterative model development workflow seen in Machine Learning. Expect an environment where you will be constantly learning and challenged to interact with tools, languages, frameworks that are outside of your area of expertise.

The (quality) doctor is in.
Modio has streamlined the convoluted and messy process that is healthcare credentialing and saved countless years of manual and error-prone work in the process. As part of CHG Healthcare we are working to drastically improve the speed (and quality) of credentialing to ensure that our doctors can spend more time treating (millions) of patients each year and less time dealing with credentialing headaches.
Our industry is growing and demand is high. This means you’ll have plenty of opportunities to grow and develop in your career. Keeping healthcare healthy can be as fun as it is rewarding.
We are open to this role being in our offices in Salt Lake City, Utah or San Francisco, California.
Your role:
Three database admins walked into a nosql bar. A little while later they walked out because they couldn’t find a table.
On a more serious note, we are looking for a data engineer. This role spans many different technical disciplines, but the overarching goals are straightforward:
Automate the ingress/egress of data from the OneView platform.
Ensure that all the data in the OneView platform is high quality (and automate the process of identifying/fixing low quality/missing data).
In this role you’ll be doing a little bit of everything to accomplish these goals. Whether that means writing new API functionality to import data, setting up/maintaining automated data pipelines, or working on advanced reporting systems is up to you. Consider yourself the glue that makes all of our data accessible and “up to snuff.” This is a highly collaborative and highly visible role; complex systems are not developed in isolation!
A little about our tech stack:
AWS
CloudFormation/Terraform
Kubernetes/Istio
js/TypeScript
Pentaho Data Integration
MySQL/Aurora
If you’re an ambitious product-minded engineer who plays well with others AND can say yes to all of these statements, we are looking for you!
You are a doer. Whether you are coming up with projects that align with our vision or helping others do the same, you are doing it proactively.
You understand how to design software and systems that are maintainable, robust, easy to understand, and capable of scaling. You also know that not every solution needs to be over-engineered.
You should be able to debug technical issues, even if the issue isn’t from “your code” or “your system”.
Your qualifications:
5+ years’ experience working with production data. Must understand things like data normalization, relational databases, data cleansing, data sandboxing, data pipelines, BI/ETL tools, and a bunch of other stuff.
Strong proficiency writing SQL. Reading SQL is a plus.
Experience working with data integration like Pentaho (or similar).
Experience setting up and maintaining data pipelines.
Professional experience working on backend API code (Node.js/TypeScript Preferred but not a hard requirement). Familiarity with defensive coding practices preferred.
Experience working on a scrum team in an agile environment.
Experience mentoring junior engineers and performing code reviews.

As a Senior Data Engineer, you will report to the Head of Data and work closely with other members of the Data team to maintain and improve data pipelines, deploy predictive models as a service, and work on our data infrastructure.

Team Philosophy:
We believe that data engineers should not write ETL, unless data pipelines are necessary to support the services that we build and maintain. Instead, your time is better spent writing tooling and creating abstractions to support the work of analysts and data scientists on the team, so that other users in the company can write and maintain their own ETL.
Everyone on the team is considered and treated as a Senior, so you are given a lot of ownership over the projects you're working on. With this in mind, we expect you to write code that is well tested, modular, and maintainable. We frown at instances of destructive fire fighting, caused by badly designed architecture or mismanaged projects.
We like learners. Hence, we create an environment where Data Scientists learn the skills and abstraction patterns of Software Engineers and Data Engineers learn the iterative model development workflow seen in Machine Learning. Expect an environment where you will be constantly learning and challenged to interact with tools, languages, frameworks that are outside of your area of expertise.
Tools, Frameworks, and Languages you will work with:

Workflow Management: Airflow
Infrastructure: Terraform, Kubernetes
Potential Projects:
Deploy trained machine learning models as a Python microservice.
Help migrate legacy ETLs into Airflow
Write tooling to make ETL accessible to engineers on other teams.
Ideal background and expertise:
5+ years of experience as a full-time professional data engineer
Experience with server-side concepts, e.g. microservices, database, caching, performance, monitoring and scalability
3+ years of experience with Python or Scala
Working experience with OLTP databases such as Postgres, MySQL
Extensive experience making data available in OLAP databases such as Redshift or Snowflake
Experience with orchestration tools such as Airflow (preferred), Luigi, Ooozie

Data Engineer (Remote),$101K-$143K (Glassdoor est.),"IZEA was built to connect the world’s top brands with influential content creators and publishers to enable influencer marketing and content production at scale. With over 500,000 Creators reaching over 3 billion fans and followers around the globe, IZEA is unmatched in its industry experience, network diversity, and technology ecosystem. A career at IZEA offers countless ways to make an impact in a fast-growing organization!

IZEA is looking for a Data Engineer to join our Core Technology group.

This team member may be located in the Orlando area or remote.

You will use the latest tools and technology to build and support IZEA's industry-leading data initiatives. Whether contributing to our data pipelines that ingest millions of records per hour, distilling vast amounts of data into meaningful insights, or operating the services that surface those insights, you will help define what the future of Influencer and Content Marketing looks like.

You will have direct access to end-users and stakeholders, and you are encouraged to build and leverage these relationships in your work. You will write and test your code, and work with our QA team to get it deployed to production. With the help of a homegrown, bot-driven CI/CD pipeline, your code will be delivered to users daily. This cross-functional team leverages Amazon Web Services for everything from ECS for containerized virtualization and hosting, to S3 for durable object storage, RDS and DynamoDB for persistence, EMR for the batch processing of billions of records, and Lambda for distributed workloads and stream consumption.

Aside from the day to day, we can offer you incredible benefits including an annual continuing education budget, a trust-focused development process, a flexible and collaborative work environment where balance matters, stock ownership, and an annual company retreat.

The team strives to be ego-free and motivated only by building amazing software for our users. We seek to understand the ""why"" behind the ""what"". We regularly break out into small teams to tackle problems, learn new technologies, or just share what we know with others. We test our code and invest in the health of our systems. We push each other, learn from each other, and strive to continually grow.

Primary Responsibilities

You will...
Work with stakeholders to define the solutions to development problems and business requirements
Develop and maintain the features and capabilities of our data ingestion pipelines
Extract actionable and impactful insights from vast amounts of data
Develop and maintain the services that surface those insights and make them available for consumption in a performant manner
Create unit and integration tests for your code
Reproduce and fix bugs reported by internal and external users
Set goals and communicate often about your progress toward them
Contribute to the ongoing improvement of the engineering organization and our software

What We’re Looking For

A problem solver at heart
Much of our work revolves around problems that have no existing off-the-shelf solution or consensus on best practices. You'll often need to break down large problems into smaller more manageable tasks and utilize critical thinking to come up with novel ideas.

3+ years of engineering experience
Things move quickly in the data group. You’ll need to be comfortable and familiar with delivering highly scalable cloud based applications.

Professional experience with frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, or similar
This will be a significant component of your responsibilities. You will be working with large data sets in a distributed environment on a daily basis. Familiarity w/ the Hadoop/Spark ecosystem is a must.

Professional experience with Python data tools
Our data team uses PySpark and Jupyter notebooks extensively. Familiarity with these technologies will also serve you well.

Direct experience with relational and NoSQL databases technologies
We use the best tool for the job around here. When it comes to storing and accessing data, we recognize that the technology decisions we make directly impact our ability to provide a performant customer experience, and our own costs.

Experience designing and building JSON based RESTful APIs
Because we are building our application with a front end framework, we carefully design and document the APIs to power it. To help us, we follow the JSON API spec, but any experience in building a RESTful API will be useful. Remember, the API is your contract with the consumers of your data!

Understanding of monolithic and micro-service based architectures
IZEAx still has some legacy monolithic characteristics. We move more and more of our technology to a distributed set of services, there are new challenges to overcome. Understanding the differences between these two models will help you take those challenges head on.

Basic Linux skills
In order to develop our data pipelines and services, you need to run it on your laptop. This means opening up some terminal windows, running some commands, and keeping the log output open. Additionally, some of our technology stack is better accessed through CLIs. Examples include the Ember CLI, the Rails CLI/console, Docker commands, Gradle, and our own CLIs. We'll walk you through it, but you should be comfy in a terminal.

Ability to multitask and prioritize multiple incoming requests
IZEA's Engineering team strives to provide a great experience and great service to our users. In order to do that, you may need to context switch into a support issue or drop what you are doing to start work on something else. This is part of what Agile means to us.

Excellent verbal and written communications skills
Regular and timely communication is the key to a trust based development process. You should be able to simply and concisely ask for feedback and direction in terms that your audience understands, and relay requested information in a timely fashion to your leaders. You should prioritize documentation of processes and code.

Demonstrated experience with the following will be highly valued

Data Science Background
While not required, a fundamental understanding of statistics and modeling would be a great asset. Practical experience with Machine Learning and/or complex data pipelines would also be welcome.

Front End development experience
From time to time you may need to build visualization, or (lite) user facing experiences. Familiarity with modern web frameworks like Angular, React, Ember, or Vue would be helpful. Extra bonus points if you have familiarity w/ Javascript based visualization libraries like d3.js or Highcharts.

Amazon Web Services, or other cloud providers
IZEA's software is hosted on AWS, and you will need to acquire some familiarity with it. Previous experience in using a cloud provider, even if just for developer tooling, shows that you understand some of the nuances involved in working in the cloud. Familiarity with Amazon’s EMR would also be an asset.

Continuous Integration & Deployment
IZEA needs to get features and fixes out to customers as soon as we possibly can with as much confidence as possible. To facilitate this, we have developed a CI/CD pipeline (using 3rd party services). An understanding of what CI/CD is will help you understand how this pipeline works and how to make it even better.

GitHub
All of IZEA's code is source controlled on Github. We leverage Github Pull Requests for code reviews, Github integrations manage parts of our CI/CD pipeline, and Github releases define the code tags that ultimately get deployed. Much of our process documentation exists on Github pages. Familiarity with navigating Github's features will help you ramp up in our SDLC faster.

JIRA
IZEA uses JIRA to manage projects and report on progress to stakeholders inside and outside the company. While we strive to automate as much of JIRA as possible with bots, webhooks and reports, understanding how JIRA issues, links, attachments, and workflows work will help you understand our SDLC faster.

About IZEA:

We are IZEA: The Creator Marketplace. Our cloud-based technologies connect Brands and Publishers with content Creators who blog, tweet, pin, and post on their behalf.

Our driving belief is that the only way to thrive in our rapidly changing world is to change ahead of it. IZEA is in a constant state of evolution and reinvention. While we may have invented the industry, we still operate like an entrepreneurial, scrappy start-up. Your time here will be exciting, educational, and at times, a bit crazy.

With IZEA, you have the opportunity to join a non-traditional corporate culture, where creativity and productivity are valued over a suit and tie. We call it ""The IZEA Way.""


Why would you want to work here?

Our developers use the latest tools and technology to build the applications and services that make up the IZEA Exchange platform. We write in whatever language we need to get the job done including Ruby, Java, Python, PHP, Swift, and Javascript. We leverage the latest frameworks, such as Rails, Symphony2, and Drop Wizard for iterating quickly on our technology.

Our code is deployed and operated by the people who write it, with the help of Amazon Web Services. We leverage everything from EC2 for virtualization and hosting, to Amazon EMR and Machine Learning for advanced analytics.

Aside from the day to day, we offer incredible benefits including an annual continuing education budget, a flexible trust-focused development process, and an open collaborative work environment.

Our team is ego-free and motivated to build great software. We regularly break out into small teams to tackle problems, learn new technologies, or just share what we know with others. We test our code and invest in the health of our systems. We push each other, learn from each other, and strive to continually grow as a team.

Senior Platform Engineer,$86K-$99K (Glassdoor est.),"Bonsai is hiring a Senior Platform Engineer to help build, scale and support the underlying technical platform that help us manage thousands of Elasticsearch clusters on AWS and GCP. This is a 100% remote full-time position. Salary ranges from $120 to $130k, based on experience.

About the job

“Hey, we’ve put your add-on in production. Good luck. Don’t crash.” —Heroku

The essence of platform engineering at Bonsai will be to operate and support Elasticsearch at scale. The emphasis here is more on the scale part than the Elasticsearch part, but you’ll definitely become intimate with Elasticsearch and Lucene along the way.There are several key components involved. First we have Elasticsearch itself. Then a handful of proprietary plugins to enhance its functionality and support its operation. From there, the networking stack that handles connections and does diagnostic tracing. Telemetry and observability across the board. Finally our packaging and deployment, and internal services for fleet orchestration. If that sounds like more than one person’s job, we agree. Your future colleague Dan is going to be particularly stoked to work with you.

You can think of this similar to a “SRE” position. When there’s an issue with performance or reliability, you’ll dig in and trace requests and analyze from load balancers down to memory managers, and help code and ship a patch to make it visible, and make it better.There’s a heavy dose of Java and Linux involved in all of this, but if you have some experience in systems programming in other languages, we can certainly teach all of that.We’re a small team, but we punch above our weight in systems engineering and operations. Launching at the right place and time dropped us into the deep end of early adopters, and we’ve been scaling ever since. Fortunately our early team was heavily engineering minded. Our original founder was previously a database engineer at Twitter when they went through their years of crazy scaling. We also hosted some massive sites like Pinterest whose 100x growth on our platform was a true trial by fire.

This position does involve wearing the metaphorical pager in a rotation with other engineers on the team. We’re on call not because we expect to be woken up, but so we’re accountable to shipping systems that never need us to!
Some example projects
Moving decentralized server-initiated threshold alerts into a centralized time-series stream analysis service.
Building a continuous delivery service that performs gradual fleetwide rollouts of new and updated services, subject to canary stages and operational verification at certain checkpoints.
Build and package new versions of Elasticsearch OSS, and update our suite of plugins to use the latest plugin interfaces, including customer-supplied proprietary plugins.
Troubleshoot a customer-supplied Elasticsearch plugin with a performance hot-spot, trace the problem to a likely location and provide support and guidance to improve efficiency.
Diagnose a server-side agent as having problematic memory usage, and port it from Ruby to Crystal to improve performance and resource usage.
Collaborate with Product engineers to build a data pipeline to support customer-facing metrics graphs.
Assist our customer support by triaging operational incidents and performing incident response.
The ideal personWe’re looking for someone experienced, who’s ready to dive in. You don’t need to be an Elasticsearch expert — you’ll learn all of that on the job. We’ll have plenty of conversations about how Lucene is really a data structures library optimized for disk access. Experience with Java is more helpful, although C, C++ and Golang would be a good starting points. We’ll also be looking for solid fundamentals in networking, disk access, memory management, and schedulers.Several of our systems make heavy use of Netty, as does Elasticsearch itself. So familiarity with Netty or evented systems will be helpful.

How we work

One More Cloud (OMC) is small, remote-first, and team-conscious.

OMC has always been comprised of a small team. As such, each of our colleagues wears many hats. We lack middle managers and dedicated Project Managers that slice and dice out work; OMC managers are also contributors. They serve as a sounding board and for coaching higher level project and career questions. Everyone is expected to manage projects together. So, our team works best with individuals who take responsibility for their to-do lists, and those who enjoy working collaboratively with teammates to plan out projects and don’t shy away from offering their opinions.

OMC has been a remote-first company from day one, and we have a lot of experience in managing and communicating across multiple timezones. One of our key ways of getting focused work done is eliminating too many meetings and video calls by writing out our thought processes, documenting steps we take, and sharing it with the team. Our ideal teammate should be comfortable with and undaunted at writing clear and logical longer-form English prose on a regular cadence.

We are team-conscious. Yes, we have a company hierarchy based on skills and the level of risk a position incurs (like responsibility for servers that have big costs attached to them). However, the onus is on every individual at OMC (regardless of hierarchy) to create a culture that allows a space for creativity, honesty, and autonomy for everyone who joins OMC. We don’t look for team heroes or martyrs but rather strive to create healthy and realistic team responsibility. We collaborate best with those who are considerate of their teammates, respect boundaries, and are dedicated to pursuing our work with curiosity, respect, and optimism.

About One More Cloud

OMC provides specialized hosted cloud services through two SAAS services: Websolr (websolr.com) and Bonsai (bonsai.io). We launched Websolr in 2009 as the first cloud hosted Solr as a service, and one of the very first batch of Heroku addons. Bonsai followed in 2012 as the first hosted Elasticsearch as a service on the market.

Our company is small, profitable, and independent. Our entire team, starting with the founders, is comprised of developers, engineers, scientists, and designers with a passion for providing useful tools and services for developers and businesses. As truth-seeking creatives and thinkers, we strive for excellence from design to execution.

We manage the search engines for ecommerce applications, social media sites, magazine archives, classifieds search, job boards and resume search, CRMs, content management systems, and more. We've been fortunate to serve teams at startups and established sites alike, such as Airbrake, Best Buy, Bullhorn, Couchsurfing, Ello, Fairfax Media, GitHub, Heroku, Muck Rack, OfferUp, Pinterest, Scripted, wikiHow, and more.

Benefits for working at OMC include:
Medical and Dental Insurance
40 hour work week. We practice healthy work and life boundaries.
Work where you want. We're a remote-first company, and have been from day one since 2009.
401k, with company contributions

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.8,"Object Partners

Everyone has family, friends and interests outside of their careers, so we offer perks and benefits to make work, work better for you.
4 weeks PTO, plus 10 sick days, and holidays. Whether it's hiking to a waterfall in Costa Rica or bonding with your couch, we all need downtime. All Gurus get four weeks paid time off, 10 sick days, and enough holiday to make a banker blush.

We want to be as transparent about the process as possible to help ease your mind. It's our goal to provide you a fair, efficient interviewing experience that respects you and your time and to do it all with a sidecar of delight.

Once you submit an application, we'll review it. If you're a good fit, you'll have an initial chat with a recruiter over the phone. A phone interview with a manager typically follows. Depending on your role, you might then be asked to do a little homework (but nothing too time consuming). Then we'll schedule a Zoom call to meet other members of the team, answer any questions you have, and give you a feel for what it's really like to work at ACG. If you're on the fence, just give it a try.

About the job

“Hey, we’ve put your add-on in production. Good luck. Don’t crash.” —Heroku

The essence of platform engineering at Bonsai will be to operate and support Elasticsearch at scale. The emphasis here is more on the scale part than the Elasticsearch part, but you’ll definitely become intimate with Elasticsearch and Lucene along the way.There are several key components involved. First we have Elasticsearch itself. Then a handful of proprietary plugins to enhance its functionality and support its operation. From there, the networking stack that handles connections and does diagnostic tracing. Telemetry and observability across the board. Finally our packaging and deployment, and internal services for fleet orchestration. If that sounds like more than one person’s job, we agree. Your future colleague Dan is going to be particularly stoked to work with you.

You can think of this similar to a “SRE” position. When there’s an issue with performance or reliability, you’ll dig in and trace requests and analyze from load balancers down to memory managers, and help code and ship a patch to make it visible, and make it better.There’s a heavy dose of Java and Linux involved in all of this, but if you have some experience in systems programming in other languages, we can certainly teach all of that.We’re a small team, but we punch above our weight in systems engineering and operations. Launching at the right place and time dropped us into the deep end of early adopters, and we’ve been scaling ever since. Fortunately our early team was heavily engineering minded. Our original founder was previously a database engineer at Twitter when they went through their years of crazy scaling. We also hosted some massive sites like Pinterest whose 100x growth on our platform was a true trial by fire.

This position does involve wearing the metaphorical pager in a rotation with other engineers on the team. We’re on call not because we expect to be woken up, but so we’re accountable to shipping systems that never need us to!
Some example projects
Moving decentralized server-initiated threshold alerts into a centralized time-series stream analysis service.
Building a continuous delivery service that performs gradual fleetwide rollouts of new and updated services, subject to canary stages and operational verification at certain checkpoints.
Build and package new versions of Elasticsearch OSS, and update our suite of plugins to use the latest plugin interfaces, including customer-supplied proprietary plugins.
Troubleshoot a customer-supplied Elasticsearch plugin with a performance hot-spot, trace the problem to a likely location and provide support and guidance to improve efficiency.
Diagnose a server-side agent as having problematic memory usage, and port it from Ruby to Crystal to improve performance and resource usage.
Collaborate with Product engineers to build a data pipeline to support customer-facing metrics graphs.
Assist our customer support by triaging operational incidents and performing incident response.
The ideal personWe’re looking for someone experienced, who’s ready to dive in. You don’t need to be an Elasticsearch expert — you’ll learn all of that on the job. We’ll have plenty of conversations about how Lucene is really a data structures library optimized for disk access. Experience with Java is more helpful, although C, C++ and Golang would be a good starting points. We’ll also be looking for solid fundamentals in networking, disk access, memory management, and schedulers.Several of our systems make heavy use of Netty, as does Elasticsearch itself. So familiarity with Netty or evented systems will be helpful.

How we work

One More Cloud (OMC) is small, remote-first, and team-conscious.

OMC has always been comprised of a small team. As such, each of our colleagues wears many hats. We lack middle managers and dedicated Project Managers that slice and dice out work; OMC managers are also contributors. They serve as a sounding board and for coaching higher level project and career questions. Everyone is expected to manage projects together. So, our team works best with individuals who take responsibility for their to-do lists, and those who enjoy working collaboratively with teammates to plan out projects and don’t shy away from offering their opinions.

OMC has been a remote-first company from day one, and we have a lot of experience in managing and communicating across multiple timezones. One of our key ways of getting focused work done is eliminating too many meetings and video calls by writing out our thought processes, documenting steps we take, and sharing it with the team. Our ideal teammate should be comfortable with and undaunted at writing clear and logical longer-form English prose on a regular cadence.

We are team-conscious. Yes, we have a company hierarchy based on skills and the level of risk a position incurs (like responsibility for servers that have big costs attached to them). However, the onus is on every individual at OMC (regardless of hierarchy) to create a culture that allows a space for creativity, honesty, and autonomy for everyone who joins OMC. We don’t look for team heroes or martyrs but rather strive to create healthy and realistic team responsibility. We collaborate best with those who are considerate of their teammates, respect boundaries, and are dedicated to pursuing our work with curiosity, respect, and optimism.

About One More Cloud

OMC provides specialized hosted cloud services through two SAAS services: Websolr (websolr.com) and Bonsai (bonsai.io). We launched Websolr in 2009 as the first cloud hosted Solr as a service, and one of the very first batch of Heroku addons. Bonsai followed in 2012 as the first hosted Elasticsearch as a service on the market.

Our company is small, profitable, and independent. Our entire team, starting with the founders, is comprised of developers, engineers, scientists, and designers with a passion for providing useful tools and services for developers and businesses. As truth-seeking creatives and thinkers, we strive for excellence from design to execution.

We manage the search engines for ecommerce applications, social media sites, magazine archives, classifieds search, job boards and resume search, CRMs, content management systems, and more. We've been fortunate to serve teams at startups and established sites alike, such as Airbrake, Best Buy, Bullhorn, Couchsurfing, Ello, Fairfax Media, GitHub, Heroku, Muck Rack, OfferUp, Pinterest, Scripted, wikiHow, and more.

Benefits for working at OMC include:
Medical and Dental Insurance
40 hour work week. We practice healthy work and life boundaries.
Work where you want. We're a remote-first company, and have been from day one since 2009.
401k, with company contributions

We remain committed to putting our people, customers, and communities first and appreciate your patience and flexibility as we work through this.
The (quality) doctor is in.
Modio has streamlined the convoluted and messy process that is healthcare credentialing and saved countless years of manual and error-prone work in the process. As part of CHG Healthcare we are working to drastically improve the speed (and quality) of credentialing to ensure that our doctors can spend more time treating (millions) of patients each year and less time dealing with credentialing headaches.
Our industry is growing and demand is high. This means you’ll have plenty of opportunities to grow and develop in your career. Keeping healthcare healthy can be as fun as it is rewarding.
We are open to this role being in our offices in Salt Lake City, Utah or San Francisco, California.
Your role:
Our Carbon platform is used to standardize healthcare credentialing data from hundreds of disparate and non-standardized data sources across the deep web. Your role as a senior engineer on the Carbon team spans many different technical disciplines, but the overarching goals are straightforward:

If you’re an ambitious reliability-oriented engineer who plays well with others AND can say yes to all of these statements, we are looking for you!
If you could dress up as anything for Halloween, you’d dress up as the open-closed principle.
You are a doer. Whether you are coming up with projects that align with our vision or helping others do the same, you are doing it proactively.
You understand how to design software and systems that are maintainable, robust, easy to understand, and capable of scaling. You also know that not every solution needs to be over-engineered.
You should be able to debug technical issues, even if the issue isn’t from “your code” or “your system”.
You don’t reinvent the wheel every time you build something new.
You can explain complex ideas in plain and simple language (most of the time).
Your qualifications:
5+ years’ experience as a site reliability engineer (or equivalent). Must understand things like caching, web scraping, exponential backoff, serverless, and rate limiting.
Professional experience working on backend API code (Node.js/TypeScript Preferred but not a hard requirement). Familiarity with defensive coding practices a must!

Experience with application metrics using StatsD/Prometheus/etc.
Experience managing on-call rotations and responding to support incidents.
Experience with container technologies such as Docker or Kubernetes.

• Has some familiarity with a front-end framework, especially Angular 1 or React.

On average we respond to 1,000 roadside assists and dispatch 200+ ambulances each month to those in need.

Offering both free and paid memberships. In addition, the company has raised over $200 million in equity financing, and recently completed an IPO on the ASX exchange giving our employees the liquidity of a public company with the upside of a private growth stage business.

Life360's rapidly growing team of 150+ employees is headquartered in San Francisco, with offices in San Diego, and Las Vegas.

About the Job:

The Cloud Engineering team is responsible for storing and processing, among other things, our massive amounts of location and driving updates. Our distributed, microservices-based environment handles billions of API calls daily, often with downstream effects which are surfaced to our users in real time, providing peace of mind and real-time emergency response to tens of millions of families.

We at Life360 have nearly doubled our user base each year for the last few years and we are focused on continuing to feed this growth for the foreseeable future. As we grow, we continue to meet the difficult challenges of increased data management and API traffic. Among the projects we are taking on in the near-to-mid future are building an event stream to upgrade our first-in-class location storage engine, splitting apart our PHP monolith into JVM-based microservices, and updating our persistence layer to meet the growing demands of storage.

Responsibilities:

The goal of the Cloud Services team is to identify potential bottlenecks which will prevent us from scaling 10x and develop solutions to these bottlenecks.

We’re on a mission to change healthcare — how it’s paid for, delivered, experienced. We want to put people center stage, not process or profit. We are guided by a deep belief that every person on Medicare should be treated like we would treat a member of our own family: with loving care and a profound commitment to their health and well-being.

That’s why we’re gathering a whole bunch of smart, big-hearted people to create a new kind of healthcare company — one that combines compassion, health insurance, clinical care, and technology seamlessly.

We want to throw the long ball with people we love for a cause we believe in. Life is short. Join us.


Why Devoted:

Make a difference... a BIG difference. You will have the opportunity, in a unique and dynamic culture, to be a part of something incredibly meaningful. We’re a disruptive startup with an inspiring mission. Learn and grow alongside our world-class team of health care, technology, and data leaders, dedicated to building a health plan and clinical services that care for everyone like they were our own mothers or fathers. Our team and board members have decades of experience in health care entrepreneurship, data, technology, services, and policy. With their support, we look forward to building a health plan and clinical services that will give seniors easy access to the high-quality care they deserve.

A bit about this role:
Technology does amazing things in our daily lives, yet often is a source of pain and confusion within health care. We want to empower Devoted to deliver a world-class member experience with simple, flexible technical systems. If we need to delve into the murky underbelly of health care IT to do that, we’re up for the challenge.

Our north star is not a specific technology, but rather the goal of continually increasing the leverage of every member of the team. We’re currently building with Go, PostgreSQL, gRPC, GraphQL, React, TypeScript, Terraform, and AWS; and we think it’s a pretty awesome stack.

We want engineer-owners with the judgment to simultaneously solve for short and long-term business value. We’re looking for folks who have worked in complex domains and systems, and come through it with some wisdom but most importantly humility. We want people who are passionate about building great technology to solve problems for users—our members, our colleagues, and ourselves.

Whether you have a healthcare background or not, we are excited to learn from and share knowledge with you. Our engineering leadership team includes seasoned alumni of healthcare and technology organizations spanning the public and private sector. Our co-founders deeply understand and care about good technology: Todd Park co-founded Athenahealth, a multi-billion-dollar healthcare technology company, and served as CTO of the U.S.; Ed Park was Athenahealth's founding engineer and served as its CTO, COO, and President of Services.
Responsibilities will include:
Building product features across a range of technologies
Working with subject matter experts to understand and design solutions to improve our members lives
Working with other members of the technology team to improve our technology platform
Attributes to success:
Experience coupled with a willingness to learn new things
Comfort with uncertainty and a desire to be close to business problems
Desire to contribute individually, with the ability both to self-direct work and to collaborate with others on the technology team
Understanding of many technologies down to first principles, and a desire to add more to the list
Desired skills and experience:
Ability to work in a fast-paced startup environment
7+ years working as a software engineer
5+ years working as an individual technical contributor
You have experience designing and developing cloud-native, scalable, and highly available distributed systems
You are skilled at taking a functional prototype and building it into a system that can survive hundreds or thousands of requests per minute. You love to dive deep into the architecture of the software.
Experience with our specific stack components a bonus, but not required
Healthcare equality is at the center of Devoted’s mission to treat our members like family. We are committed to a diverse and vibrant workforce. If you lack a specific credential for this position but believe that your strengths and life experiences will propel our mission, we would love to hear from you.

If you love running towards complex challenges and transforming them into solutions, if you want to make a potentially huge impact on many lives, and if you are looking for a disruptive startup with an inspiring and talented team, Devoted Health may be the place for you!

Data Engineer,$105K-$190K(Employer est.),"Our Government and Large Commercial high-profile clients are high-tech organizations with programs in science, technology, engineering and math. For these positions, they are asking for us to provide data analysts that are passionate about transforming and making data usable for new services, business models, and to help economic development. We are looking for people that believe data is the new gold.

We are looking for data analysts, data wranglers, data scientists with excellent leadership, technical, and subject matter expertise qualities. We have projects lining up developing research-grade science data algorithms from in-situ sensors to bringing together data sources from disparate sub-agencies into enterprise platforms to make available on open-data platforms. We have projects that are creating data and bigdata prototypes whether it be on CartoDB geospatial, D3 Sankeys and various libraries, feeding and harvesting RDF Triplets into catalogs, or integrating into SEO environments. Admittedly, we have some less sexy data wrangling and janitor tasks that will require more ETL skills to hone in on.

To boot, we want our analysts to be natural change agents and passionate about change while empathetic to the clients environment on how they leverage, mature, and incorporate data products, services, and new capabilities. We want leaders who can both support the influence of the right change direction while managing the technical and business analysis and design, and are skilled and self-motivated with solid domain/subject matter expertise.

Our analysts will be on teams that, through facilitated analysis, work shoulder-to-shoulder with teammates to come up with the conceptual and logical design and architecture. Analysts will also be working very closely with client staff or system integrators to rapidly implement changes or agile release. Furthermore, we devise and craft strategies and communications solutions to broadcast and brag about their change efforts and results. This is what we do – we bring transformations to life.

Position Requirements:
You will be expected to rapidly ramp-up on client lingo, proactively make observations of patterns, anomalies, problems, and be customer service focused. You will be expected to be highly self-motivated and understand you will be held accountable to commitments. We look for decisive individuals able to rapidly respond to change requests and able to communicate, track, and escalate risk. We expect you to be proactive, efficient, and ready to learn quickly in response to all client and team member needs. This is a bootcamp-type position setup for growth.

We want you to not only gain technical skills, but also grow your interactive and client facing skills. All roles will require strong communication and interactive skills - oral, written, visual especially for triaging conflict, ideation barriers, mitigating risk, foster thought diversity and team environment. We expect all our roles to have a mastery of their technical level at their role whether that be in architectural methods, languages, work products, consulting techniques, and client culture. If they are not, they need to demonstrate how they are VERY fast learners.

For the technical prowess, we will want you to demonstrate your data science nerd-dom and technology stack as part of normal vernacular in one or many of these stacks (well, technologies in these stacks depending on the project). Of course, by no means do we expect all of the technologies, but prowess in one of the stacks:
Data Transformation – ETL, perl, python, SQL, FTP, Informatica, SAFE/FME, Kettle, GeoKettle
Machine Learning - Markov or Markov Chain, Naive Bayes, N-Grams, Levenshtein distance or Damerau-Levenshtein distance, Fuzzy Search, NLP,
Algorithm Development and Visualization – R, Octave, MatLAB, OpenCV, Viola-Jones Haar-Cascade
Geospatial Transformation – GEOJson, CartoDB, K-Means, Nearest Neighbor, Anselin Local Moran's, Monte Carlo Simulation, Mantel Index, Standard Deviational Ellipse, GeoServer, ESRI, ESRI/Hadoop, PostGIS
Web BI – NodeJS, PHP, Web JavaScript libs like jQuery, ExtJS, D3JS, R Project, HTML5, CSS3, Many more.
NoSQL – MongDB, Hadoop, CouchDB, Solr, ElasticSearch
From a skillset of functions, our data science analysts would need to have a strong focus in one or more of these core areas:
Open Data User Experience - Someone who has gathered public data and used it in a project (and/or application), is aware that there is an industry wide 'current debate' about open data, and has filed a CORA/FOIA request to gather data.
Analysis - Someone who can 'read' a dataset and 'tell its story' - top points for ""food desert analysis"", ""restaurant inspections analysis"", ""bike trails routing analysis"" - or any other specific ""human geography"" and/or ""land use"" analysis. Ideally this person can use tools like GIS/RS, Tableau, Carto, D3, JavaScript, Python, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator.
Manual Data Entry - Has an eye for detail and has patience to meticulously check and double check others' data entry, and a desire to work with metadata. Can work in Excel and Google Sheets.
Data Wrangling - Can manipulate and verify transformations on data, also has general knowledge of coding languages, can read/edit JavaScript, SQL, Python, Ogr2Ogr, GDAL.
Database Administration - Has a basic familiarity with relational database and geodatabase structures, organizing and maintaining data, metadata.
Finally, our data science analysts will need to meet the following:
1 year of consulting experience – higher compensation for additional 3 more years in related analytical work products and additional 2 more years in subject matter
Could pass ad-hoc technical and whiteboard test given various data ETL and other patterns of real-time, large data, data cleanup, etc. scenarios
For public sector work, our work is traditionally unclassified, but will require certain amount of background, reference, and other checks
Travel will be maximum 20%
We emphasize a balance of work and life and target 40-50 hour weeks with ample times to refresh with great paid-time off.
We currently do not have an opening at this time.

We review our requirements quarterly and this could change. We like to plan ahead in finding amazing talent.
